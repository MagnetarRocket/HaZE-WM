		HaZe 0.2
	a real B&W window manager 
	
	

v0.2

-------------------
    Overview
-------------------

HaZe is a hacked window manager based on mlvwm, the nice wm
of Takac Hasegawa (hase@rop2.hitachi-cable.co.jp) with the
MacOS appearance. mlvwm is based on Twm and fvwm.

Provisionally, HaZe retains a lot of the mlvwm feature, so
it should be very compatible with it. System8 doesn't work
fine due to the radikal look of HaZe (!).

-------------------
   What's Haze?
-------------------

HaZe is robust, efficient and light weighted. Basic features
HaZe provides are:

	*Multiple virtual desktops
	*Menu bar configurable
	*Shaded windows
	*Governed windows from the menu bar
	*Small size of the code
	*Are you thinking in anything else?

-------------------
 What is Haze not?
-------------------

HaZe like another wm (i.e. 9wm, wmx, wm2, etc) is designed
for ascetic unix/linux users who launch their applications
from the command line, but like some menu entries for the 
most common tasks. Therefore, HaZe provides:

	*No iconizing (shade it/hide it)
	*No big files in your hard disk
	*No memory and CPU time for unuseful tasks
	*No libraries dependencies
	*Anything else ?



-------------------
 At your own risk
-------------------
We don't assume all responsibility toward any situation
which responded by the use of this window manager, either.
No e-mail for bug report, requests or so... be pacient and
wait for the next release or... repair the bug yourself.


-------------------
  Installation
-------------------

The default installation directory is /usr/local. HaZe will 
create the /usr/local/share/haze directory for images and 
icons and the binary in /usr/local/bin. If you need to change
the root, please edit the Makefile and change the INSTALL_DIR
variable to the right directory.

Then, do

	make
	make install (as root)

Copy the style/hazerc file to your home directory

	cp -f style/hazerc $HOME/.hazerc
	
for configure the HaZe behaviour and the menu.


If you want to be in the HaZe spirit, please add the entries 
of the style/Xdefaults file to your own .Xdefaults. 


-------------------
  Running HaZe
-------------------

Execute  starthaze  from the command line.


-------------------
  More about HaZe
-------------------

Some applications that understand standard Xt command line
arguments and X resources, like xterm and xfontsel, allow 
the user to specify the start-up desk on the command line:

            xterm -xrm "*Desk:1"

will start an xterm on desk number 1. Not all applications 
understand this option, however.

The CONFIGURATION file describes how to configure HaZe from
the .hazerc file. Please, review it.

-------------------
  Deinstallation
-------------------

	make uninstall

 Volunteers finded
-------------------

HaZe is maintened by argonaut_@yahoo.com but almost all 
projects HELP will be very very apreciated. The idea is to
begin a bigger project to develop HaZe much more. So, if
you are interested, please let me know. 

Feel free to hack the code and make changes...if you have
some significative improvement send it to me.

Thanks
